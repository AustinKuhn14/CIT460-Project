# CIT460-Project
Semester long project for Advanced Topics in Programming 

Description
-----------
The goal of this project is to create a system that uses the pipe-to-pipe architecture. This focuses on the process of putting raw data through a series of modular stages, including data ingestion, validation, transformation, storage, and visualization. The systemn will be designed to operate independently, which allows for improvements in maintainability, scalability, and reliability. Within this process the data is stored to a database to keep the processed data instead of just tranfering the API which evertually will lose or change that data. Afterwards the data is recieved from the database and used for analytics and visualization of the data in a dashboard format. Once completed the system will be deployed over Microsoft Azure.

Project Plan
------------
Sprint 1:
- Identify and connect to data sources
- Validate and clean incoming data
- Design and implement database schema
- Persist processed data and produce sample output

Sprint 2:
- Build dashboard interface
- Implement data visualizations
- Add logging for data flow and error tracking

Sprint 3:
- Deploy application to Microsoft Azure
- Configure cloud database and hosting services
- Improve performance, reliability, and usability
- Final testing and documentation
